Ferret Example
==============

(Maybe the world's first) iOS app written in [Ferret language](https://ferret-lang.org).

This is an example for writing iOS app with an arbitrary programming language.

Install
-------

Since the project includes Ferret languages compiler as Git submodule, you need to install the following tools to build the compiler.

- Xcode 11.5
- Emacs (>= 24.5)
- Leiningen

You can install Emacs and Leiningen through Homebrew.

    brew install emacs leiningen

Then clone with submodules.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/manicmaniac/FerretExample.git


You can run the app with `FerretExample` scheme.
